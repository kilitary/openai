    "\n",
    "The frequency range of 1380 MHz to 1620 MHz is part of the L-band of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is primarily used for various communication systems and satellite applications. Here are some key uses for this frequency range:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GPS (Global Positioning System): The L1 band, operating at 1575.42 MHz, is used for GPS signal transmission. It is used by GPS receivers to accurately determine the user's location, velocity, and timing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Satellite Communications: Many satellites transmit and receive signals within the L-band. This frequency range can be used for satellite broadcasting, mobile satellite communications, and satellite internet services.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Aeronautical Communications: In aviation, the L-band is used for air traffic control communications, data link services, and aircraft tracking. It ensures reliable communication between pilots and control towers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Radio Astronomy: Some radio telescopes operate in the L-band to capture signals from space and study celestial objects. This frequency range is used for tasks like monitoring interstellar molecules, studying pulsars, and detecting hydrogen emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Radio Navigation Systems: Besides GPS, other positioning systems, such as GLONASS (Russian navigation system) and Beidou (Chinese navigation system), also use frequencies within the L-band for satellite-based positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Mobile Phone Networks: Certain cellular networks, particularly 2G and some 3G networks, also operate within this frequency range. However, the usage of this range for mobile networks varies across different countries and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning that specific frequency allocations within the L-band may vary from country to country, so the exact use and availability of these frequencies can differ based on local regulations and allocation plans.\n",
