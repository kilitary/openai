    "# How to call functions with chat models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers how to use the Chat Completions API in combination with external functions to extend the capabilities of GPT models.\n",
    "\n",
    "`functions` is an optional parameter in the Chat Completion API which can be used to provide function specifications. The purpose of this is to enable models to generate function arguments which adhere to the provided specifications. Note that the API will not actually execute any function calls. It is up to developers to execute function calls using model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `functions` parameter is provided then by default the model will decide when it is appropriate to use one of the functions. The API can be forced to use a specific function by setting the `function_call` parameter to `{\"name\": \"<insert-function-name>\"}`. The API can also be forced to not use any function by setting the `function_call` parameter to `\"none\"`. If a function is used, the output will contain `\"finish_reason\": \"function_call\"` in the response, as well as a `function_call` object that has the name of the function and the generated function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the following 2 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to generate function arguments:** Specify a set of functions and use the API to generate function arguments.\n",
    "- **How to call functions with model generated arguments:** Close the loop by actually executing functions with model generated arguments."

    "# Troubleshooting Drone Battery Failure Sorted by X or Y Axis Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Sorted by X/Y Axis Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Battery Calibration (70%)**: Calibration often involves actively using the drone in multiple axes to ensure that the battery is operating correctly. This could place the most stress on the battery in terms of X or Y-axis usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flight Log & Diagnostics (60%)**: Examining flight logs will often involve a review of axis-specific data, including maneuvers that may heavily use X or Y-axis movements. Patterns in the logs could hint at issues related to these axes affecting battery life.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Environmental Conditions (50%)**: While not directly related to axis usage, flying in challenging environments (e.g., windy conditions) often requires more aggressive use of controls along various axes, which in turn can affect battery life.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Short Flight Time (40%)**: Short flight time issues are often directly related to how much you're demanding from the drone's control systems, including frequent or aggressive use of X or Y-axis controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inspect the Battery (30%)**: Physical inspection won't involve the axes, but a damaged or swollen battery may produce symptoms more readily during aggressive flying, which includes X or Y-axis maneuvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Check Connections (20%)**: Secure and intact connections ensure that the drone can handle the electrical demands of complex maneuvers along any axis. A poor connection could manifest most clearly during such maneuvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Software Update (20%)**: Updated software/firmware ensures that the drone's power management systems are optimized, potentially even for complex maneuvers that involve X or Y-axis movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Sudden Power Loss (15%)**: Although this is more a symptom than a cause, sudden power loss might occur more frequently with aggressive X or Y-axis movements, indicating a battery issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Replace Battery (10%)**: A new battery will generally be more reliable, regardless of how you're using the drone's controls. But a new battery is less likely to fail during aggressive X or Y-axis maneuvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Inconsistent Charge, Overheating, No Charge, and Poor Maintenance (5%)**: These factors are generally less related to axis-specific movements and more related to the overall health and condition of the battery itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Consult Manufacturer Support (0%)**: Consulting support or reading the manual doesn't involve the drone's axes but can provide valuable information for resolving battery issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Review User Manual (0%)**: Like consulting manufacturer support, reading the user manual doesn't involve using the drone's axes but is valuable for troubleshooting.\n"
