    "# How to build a tool-using agent with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes you through how to use LangChain to augment an OpenAI model with access to external tools. In particular, you'll be able to create LLM agents that use custom tools to answer user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Langchain?\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Their framework enables you to build layered LLM-powered applications that are context-aware and able to interact dynamically with their environment as agents, leading to simplified code for you and a more dynamic user experience for your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do LLMs need to use Tools?\n",
    "One of the most common challenges with LLMs is overcoming the lack of recency and specificity in their training data - answers can be out of date, and they are prone to hallucinations given the huge variety in their knowledge base. Tools are a great method of allowing an LLM to answer within a controlled context that draws on your existing knowledge bases and internal APIs - instead of trying to prompt engineer the LLM all the way to your intended answer, you allow it access to tools that it calls on dynamically for info, parses, and serves to customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing LLMs access to tools can enable them to answer questions with context directly from search engines, APIs or your own databases. Instead of answering directly, an LLM with access to tools can perform intermediate steps to gather relevant information. Tools can also be used in combination. [For example](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/examples/mrkl_chat.html), a language model can be made to use a search tool to lookup quantitative information and a calculator to execute calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup:** Import packages and connect to a Pinecone vector database.\n",
    "- **LLM Agent:** Build an agent that leverages a modified version of the [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) framework to do chain-of-thought reasoning.\n",
    "- **LLM Agent with History:** Provide the LLM with access to previous steps in the conversation.\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base:** Create a knowledge base of \"Stuff You Should Know\" podcast episodes, to be accessed through a tool.\n",
    "- **LLM Agent with Tools:** Extend the agent with access to multiple tools and test that it uses them to answer questions."

    "\n",
    "An [LLM agent](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/custom_llm_agent.html) in Langchain has many configurable components, which are detailed in the Langchain documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll employ a few of the core concepts to make an agent that talks in the way we want, can use tools to answer questions, and uses the appropriate language model to power the conversation.\n",
    "- **Prompt Template:** The input template to control the LLM's behaviour and how it accepts inputs and produces outputs - this is the brain that drives your application ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates.html)).\n",
    "- **Output Parser:** A method of parsing the output from the prompt. If the LLM produces output using certain headers, you can enable complex interactions where variables are generated by the LLM in their response and passed into the next step of the chain ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/output_parsers.html)).\n",
    "- **LLM Chain:** A Chain brings together a prompt template with an LLM that will execute it - in this case we'll be using ```gpt-3.5-turbo``` but this framework can be used with OpenAI completions models, or other LLMs entirely ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html)).\n",
    "- **Tool:** An external service that the LLM can use to retrieve information or execute commands should the user require it ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools.html)).\n",
    "- **Agent:** The glue that brings all of this together, an agent can call multiple LLM Chains, each with their own tools. Agents can be extended with your own logic to allow retries, error handling and any other methods you choose to add reliability to your application ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** Before using this cookbook with the Search tool you'll need to sign up on https://serpapi.com/ and generate an API key. Once you have it, store it in an environment variable named ```SERPAPI_API_KEY```"
